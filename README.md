Overview of Project: 
The purpose of this analysis was to build a web app that helps us gather data from javascript file while using filters for easier access to specific information. I found this application can have many uses for different forms of data at work.

Results: 
The resulting website provides users the capability to learn about UFO sightings all over the US.  They can filter by cities, states, dates or shapes of UFOs spotted.  The web app allows users to filter by multiple parameters if they wanted to identify any patterns. The user can also read comments from people that have spotted any UFO's and compare with other comments from others. 

Summary: 
I have developed a functioning Javascript based web application using the flask framework that allows users to study UFO sightings and filter to identify commonalities and differences.  They can filter through the data set by using a robust search filter to help understand any potential patterns.  For further development I would recommend filter for comments to help users determine if any common comments have been found.  I would also recommend another filter for duration.  In addition, there is an opportunity to add additional countries to increase the value of tool.
